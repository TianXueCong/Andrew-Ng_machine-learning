### What is the machine learning
`Arthur Samuele(1959) Machine Learning`:  Field of study that gives computers the ability to learning without being explicitly programmed.  
`TOME Mitchell(1998):`  Well-posed Learning Problem:A computer program is said to learn form experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  
* example: `playing checkers`  
E= the experience of playing many games of checkers  
T= the task of playing checkers  
P= the probability that the program will win the next game  
* ML algorithms can be classified as follow:  
supervixed learning and unsupervised learning   
others: reinforcement learning , recommender systems
