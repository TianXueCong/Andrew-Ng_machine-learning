Large margin classification

### Optimization objective

### Large margin intuition

From the above picture, the back line is SVM decision boundary (intuition). Large margin classifier is the distance between the black line and blue line.

When the C is very large, the clasifier will make training dataset correct, the decision boundary will be pink line. When C is small, the decision boundary will be black line.
